CRUD- Create, Read, Update, Delete

API First
 it is restful from the start
 it can support multi projects



 Create server- Named mean APP


 Create Index.js

 add dpendencies -
 by adding var express= require('express'), im really assigning that dependency/libary to the variable

 Midddleware- intercepts itself into the request. then provides something unique to teh pluggin


CORs allows us to expose our API'S to our server making it public

(ref line 31 index.js)add content of "Hello World"
 use method on app and call it by the path ('/hello') then you pass in the call back function: which is exected with the request, response and teh next call back.

 	next command signals you can go onto teh next middleware
